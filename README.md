# supabase_radical

This project is designed to manage user profiles in a Supabase application. It includes SQL commands to create a `radical_users` table, set up Row Level Security (RLS), and define a trigger for handling new users in the Supabase Auth system.

## Project Structure

```
supabase_radical
├── test
│   └── create.sql        # SQL commands for creating tables and triggers
├── .gitignore             # Specifies files to ignore in Git
├── .env.example           # Template for environment variables
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supabase_radical.git
   cd supabase_radical
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for your environment.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.

4. **Run SQL Commands**
   Execute the SQL commands in `test/create.sql` to set up the database schema.

## Usage

- The `radical_users` table is used to store user profiles.
- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled to ensure that users can only access their own data.
- A trigger is set up to automatically create a profile entry when a new user signs up via Supabase Auth.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
